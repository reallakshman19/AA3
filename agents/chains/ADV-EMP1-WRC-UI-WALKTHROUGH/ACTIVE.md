ISSUE_1559_GITHUB_STATE: CLOSED_COMPLETED
ISSUE_1559_TECHNICAL_ACCEPTANCE: NOT_PROVEN
DEPENDENCIES: faithful repository checkout plus project-local Node dependencies with the repository-supported Playwright runner, Chromium execution, 12 viewport + 12 full-page + 12 ARIA + manifest v3, then qualified human live observation or review of a recording

LATEST_EXECUTION_PROBE: exact-main source/runtime retry; git github.com DNS blocked; direct codeload.github.com archive DNS blocked; @playwright/test/playwright/vite absent; npm registry EAI_AGAIN; system Chromium remains independently proven usable

EXACT_NEXT_ACTION: on an environment with a faithful checkout of current main and project-local Node dependencies run node scripts/run-playwright.mjs e2e/emp1-professional-walkthrough-evidence.spec.js --workers=1; inspect 12/12/12 + manifest v3; then qualified live/recorded pressure-vessel/local-stress review; if a defect is found create a new PRE_MUTATION endpoint before patching
