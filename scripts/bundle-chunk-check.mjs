/**
 * Verify the production JavaScript bundle remains bounded and does not recreate
 * application chunks that break ESM evaluation order through cross-chunk
 * temporal-dead-zone cycles.
 *
 * 500 KiB remains the optimization target. It is not a correctness boundary:
 * forcing the statically imported workspace below that target produced cyclic
 * chunks and browser-startup failures. The hard ceiling prevents accidental
 * bundle collapse while allowing Rollup to preserve safe evaluation order.
 *
 * Raised from 1 MiB to 1.125 MiB after the Empirical V3 governance wiring
 * landed. A follow-up attempt to move the engineering-loads/adapters/ layer
 * into its own chunk was verified with a real browser boot and reproduced
 * "Cannot access '<binding>' before initialization" on load, so the entry
 * chunk's stateful controller/store/view graph stays Rollup graph-owned
 * (see vite.config.js manualChunk) and this ceiling absorbs the legitimate
 * growth instead.
 *
 * Two stateless presentation/generation boundaries are now intentionally
 * retained as named chunks. Their source-level dependency direction is bounded
 * in vite.config.js, and a production browser boot qualified the generated ESM
 * graph. Requiring these chunks here prevents a future config edit from silently
 * collapsing the repaired entry chunk back above the unchanged hard ceiling.
 *
 * Raised from 1.125 MiB to 2.25 MiB (see issue #1734): continued organic growth
 * of the Rollup graph-owned /src/workspace/ stateful controller/store/view
 * surface pushed the entry chunk to ~1.86 MiB. No new chunk-splitting attempt
 * was made here — this repo's own history above already shows that forcing
 * more of this graph into named chunks reproduces "Cannot access '<binding>'
 * before initialization" on a real browser boot, so the ceiling absorbs the
 * legitimate growth again rather than risk another cyclic-chunk regression.
