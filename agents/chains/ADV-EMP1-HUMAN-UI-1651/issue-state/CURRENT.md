## Merge / custody state

- Original implementation PR #1675: MERGED.
- Repair chain through LEG-013 PR #1701: MERGED as `f98d56d4c644b7bb6b79d2302739d12dac720248`.
- LEG-014 focused synchronization repair PR #1708: MERGED as `695538dd713f2ef11fb00e54b86073f19d38684a`.
- Owner-waiver/self-check custody PR #1719: MERGED as `754bf8f4ac869b087063ac1181513f6012684e2f`.
- Custody PR #1720: MERGED from exact head `dedf1f9c4247d73e6fd4aac7eabf644066bc633c` as `17661f1e538a11a01bd67d2be56eccc60b608927`.
- PR #1720 merge authorization is consumed.
- Active custody: Draft PR #1723 on `agent/emp1-1651-post-merge-ep0049`.
- EP-0050 consumes Owner `proceed next` as NO_PATCH post-merge executable-evidence wait.
- No merge authorization carries to PR #1723.
- No LEG-015 is open; no production material mutation occurred.

## Administrative exclusion

Issues #1724-#1730 were accidentally created by a GitHub tool-action selection fault during EP-0050 execution and immediately closed `not_planned`. They are not part of this chain, carry no authority/evidence/custody/roadmap status, and must not be interpreted as engineering work items.

## Owner disposition retained

Independent review remains **WAIVED_BY_OWNER** for the executable-evidence/custody path. Assistant self-check remains **AUTHORIZED_BY_OWNER** for scope/review inspection only. Executable validation itself is not waived.

## Live main / drift

LIVE_MAIN_HEAD_AT_EP0050: `17661f1e538a11a01bd67d2be56eccc60b608927`
MAIN_DRIFT_SINCE_EP0049: FALSE
PR1720_DELTA_CLASS: `CUSTODY_METADATA_ONLY`
PR1718_POST_BASIS_DRIFT: `METADATA_ONLY`
PR1639_POST_BASIS_DRIFT: `MATERIAL_WITHIN_QUALIFIED_BOUNDARY`
REQUALIFICATION_REQUIRED_BY_CURRENT_DRIFT: FALSE

PR #1720 merged only this chain's custody files. The inherited PR #1639 lazy EMP.1 product-loading boundary remains the material runtime obligation and must be exercised by P1-B.

## Original acceptance ledger

- TASK-001 | Live-DOM raw-machine-token regression gate. | SOURCE RETAINED; final live acceptance pending.
- TASK-002 | Pressure 5 identities × Internal/External = 10 governed cells. | SOURCE RETAINED/MERGED; live confirmation pending.
- TASK-003 | Anti-waterfall task shell / one active task / selected evidence only. | SOURCE MERGED; human-factor desktop/narrow re-observation pending.
- TASK-004 | CAUx staged benchmark UI with physical keyboard behavior. | SOURCE RETAINED/MERGED; physical Enter/Space and visual evidence pending.
- TASK-005 | Preserve numerical/source/tolerance/sign/axis/route/code/release authority. | PRESERVED through EP-0050.

## Validation truth / pending activity

Historical exact pre-LEG-014 runner `f98d56d…`: browser preflight PASS, five Node gates PASS, focused Playwright FAIL because `emp1ExecutionStatus` was sampled as `null`, runner `FAIL_EXECUTABLE_GATE_SEQUENCE`, Stage-17/human-factor NOT_RUN.

### P0 — review / custody
Status: **COMPLETE_BY_OWNER_DISPOSITION**. No independent reviewer is required. Assistant self-check is accepted for scope/review inspection only.

### P1-A — frozen EMP.1 integration proof
Exact target: `695538dd713f2ef11fb00e54b86073f19d38684a`
Status: **NOT_RUN**.
Observed status contexts: 0. Observed PR-triggered workflow runs: 0. Zero is not PASS.

Governed command:
```text
PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH=0 node scripts/emp1-issue1651-executable-validation.mjs
```
Required success: five Node gates PASS, focused Playwright 2/0, Stage-17 exit 0, final `PASS_EXECUTABLE_EXACT_HEAD_GATE_SEQUENCE`.

### P1-B — current-main regression proof
Exact target at EP-0050: `17661f1e538a11a01bd67d2be56eccc60b608927`
Status: **NOT_RUN / GATED_BY_P1A**.
Observed status contexts: 0. Observed PR-triggered workflow runs: 0. Zero is not PASS.
After P1-A PASS, re-ground live main and run the same governed carrier on that exact head. The run must exercise the inherited PR #1639 lazy product-transaction import boundary.

### P2 — human-factor acceptance
Status: **NOT_RUN / GATED**. Only after executable PASS: desktop >1050 default and Readiness-open, narrow 720×900, exactly seven workflow controls, one active task, inactive/unselected layout suppression, heavy evidence <=1, Pressure 5×2, Local Correlation authority presentation, CAUx physical Enter/Space, visible `Engineering use not authorized`, and three retained screenshots.

### P3 — acceptance reconciliation / closure
Resolve TASK-001..005 from live evidence. Close #1664 then #1651 only if every acceptance condition passes. Any production/material repair requires a new exact Owner progression command.

## Roadmap

- R1 acceptance-first falsifiers: IMPLEMENTED; runtime proof pending.
- R2 task-shell compositor: MERGED.
- R3 progressive evidence workspace: MERGED at source level; live proof pending.
- R4 live acceptance: PENDING executable PASS.

`EMP_TAB_UI_RECOMMENDATIONS.md@d616a4ea014d583c9709a872c3af3896dea9011e` remains historical design rationale; roadmap mutation authority remains NONE.

## Benchmark / authority ledger

- CAUx retained comparison: 8/8 within frozen 3%; worst relative 2.0355862430856293% at Cu; worst absolute 26.786740343133943 kPa at Du; Du/Du governing agreement; comparison only; `engineeringUseAuthorized=false` remains non-authorizing.
- PV Elite: `REFERENCE_NOT_AVAILABLE` / `SOURCE_NOT_RETAINED`; zero rows; no invented expected values, version or tolerance.
- Pressure remains 5 identities × Internal/External = 10 governed cells.
- Bounded route `EMP1.C.WRC537.CYLINDRICAL.ORIGINAL.GAMMA5.ZERO_DP` retains its existing bounded engineering-use authorization.
- Global/full-domain WRC production authority remains unclaimed/unregistered.
- EP-0050 changes no WRC equations/tables/curves/applicability/sign/axes/SCFs, benchmark source/tolerance/authority, route authorization, code compliance, production authorization or release authority. PR #1639's unresolved validation debt is not promoted to PASS.

CURRENT_BLOCKER: P1-A executable validation on exact `695538dd713f2ef11fb00e54b86073f19d38684a` remains NOT_RUN. P1-B remains gated and must be retargeted to the then-current main at execution time; human-factor remains gated.

EXACT_NEXT_ACTION: remain READ_ONLY awaiting actual P1-A executable evidence. Evidence intake requires no new progression. If P1-A passes, re-ground live main and run P1-B on that exact head while exercising the inherited lazy EMP.1 transaction boundary. No merge authorization carries to PR #1723. Any production/material repair after a failed executable observation requires another exact Owner progression command.
